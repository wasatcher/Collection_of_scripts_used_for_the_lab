# Collection_of_scripts_used_for_the_lab
A collection of scripts used for the lab rodent behavior assay result analyses

These include the simple Python scripts to analyze the following:

--- Grimace test: extract frames out of videos taken

--- Grimace test: remove the unwanted frames

--- Open Field Test

--- Elevated Plus Maze

Note: Will integrate two grimace scripts into one whenever available for it.
